# Role Definitions

This directory contains role definitions for software development teams. Each file describes a specific role, its responsibilities, required expertise, and other important aspects.

## Structure

Each role is defined in a YAML file with the following structure:

- **role**: The name of the role
- **description**: A comprehensive description of the role's purpose and main responsibilities
- **responsibilities**: Key tasks and duties associated with the role
- **expertise**: Technical skills and knowledge required for the role
- **tools_and_technologies**: Essential and recommended tools and technologies for the role
- **characteristics**: Personal qualities and soft skills needed for the role
- **interaction_with**: Other roles this role typically collaborates with, including the nature of interaction
- **decision_authority**: Areas where this role has final decision-making authority
- **scalability**: How the role adapts in different team sizes
- **agile_mapping**: How the role maps to Agile/Scrum frameworks and ceremonies
- **knowledge_sharing**: Ways the role contributes to organizational knowledge
- **career_path**: Potential career progression and skills to develop
- **remote_work_considerations**: Guidelines for effective remote collaboration in this role
- **success_criteria**: Metrics to evaluate performance in the role
- **key_performance_indicators**: Measurable metrics to evaluate performance

## Files

- **role_schema.json**: JSON Schema defining the structure for all role files
- **role_template.yaml**: Template for creating new role files
- **[role_name].yaml**: Individual role definition files

## Guidelines for Creating or Modifying Roles

1. **Use the template**: Start with `role_template.yaml` when creating a new role.
2. **Follow the schema**: Ensure your role definition conforms to the schema defined in `role_schema.json`.
3. **Be specific**: Provide detailed and specific information for each section.
4. **Consider interactions**: Clearly define how the role interacts with other roles.
5. **Define authority**: Clearly specify areas where the role has decision-making authority.
6. **Include measurable KPIs**: Define concrete, measurable key performance indicators.
7. **Consider scalability**: Describe how the role adapts in different team sizes.
8. **Map to Agile**: Specify how the role fits into Agile/Scrum frameworks.

## Required vs. Optional Sections

The following sections are required for all role definitions:
- role
- description
- responsibilities
- expertise
- characteristics
- interaction_with
- success_criteria

All other sections are optional but recommended for a comprehensive role definition.

## Example Interaction Definition

When defining interactions with other roles, use the following format:

```yaml
interaction_with:
  - "Product Owner (receives: product requirements; provides: design solutions)"
  - "Developer (collaborates: on implementation feasibility)"
```

This clearly indicates what the role receives from, provides to, or how it collaborates with other roles.

## Example Decision Authority

When defining decision authority, be specific about the areas where the role has final say:

```yaml
decision_authority:
  - "Visual design direction and aesthetic choices"
  - "User interface component behavior"
```

## Example KPIs

KPIs should be measurable and specific:

```yaml
key_performance_indicators:
  - "Deployment frequency: Number of deployments per week"
  - "Change failure rate: Percentage of deployments causing failures"
```
