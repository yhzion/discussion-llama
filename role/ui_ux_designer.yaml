interaction_with:
  - "Product Owner (receives: product requirements and vision; provides: design solutions and UX recommendations)"
  - "User Researcher (receives: research insights and user data; provides: design questions for research)"
  - "Frontend Developer (provides: design specifications and assets; receives: implementation feedback)"
  - "Backend Developer (collaborates: on data structure needs for UI components)"
  - "Content Strategist / Technical Writer (collaborates: on content placement and information architecture)"
  - "QA Engineer (provides: design specifications for testing; receives: usability issues)"
  - "Project Manager (provides: design timelines and dependencies; receives: project constraints)"
  - "Technical Architect (receives: technical constraints; provides: UX requirements for architecture)"

decision_authority:
  - Visual design direction and aesthetic choices
  - Interaction patterns and user flows
  - Design system components and guidelines
  - UI component behavior and micro-interactions
  - Design tool selection and workflow processes
  - Accessibility implementation in design
  - Design quality standards and acceptance criteria

scalability:
  - "Small team: In small teams, the UI/UX Designer may also handle user research responsibilities and some frontend implementation. May work directly on production-ready assets."
  - "Large team: In large teams, may specialize in either UI or UX, with dedicated roles for visual design, interaction design, and design systems. Works with dedicated user researchers and content designers."

agile_mapping:
  - "Scrum role: Development Team Member"
  - "Sprint Planning: Provides input on design tasks and estimates"
  - "Daily Scrum: Updates on design progress and blockers"
  - "Sprint Review: Demonstrates completed design work"
  - "Sprint Retrospective: Contributes to process improvements for design workflow"
  - "Backlog Refinement: Helps clarify design requirements and complexity"

knowledge_sharing:
  - Conduct design system workshops and documentation
  - Share design thinking processes and methodologies
  - Provide design critiques and feedback sessions
  - Create reusable design patterns and component libraries
  - Document design decisions and rationales
  - Mentor junior designers and provide guidance to developers on UI implementation

career_path:
  - "Next steps: Senior UI/UX Designer, Lead Designer, Design Manager, UX Director, Chief Design Officer"
  - "Skills to develop: Strategic design thinking, Design leadership and team management, Business acumen and product strategy, Advanced research methodologies, Design operations and scaling design processes"

remote_work_considerations:
  - Establish clear design review and feedback processes for asynchronous work
  - Use collaborative design tools with robust commenting and versioning features
  - Schedule regular design critique sessions via video conferencing
  - Create detailed documentation for handoff to distributed development teams
  - Maintain up-to-date design system documentation accessible to all team members
  - Develop clear annotation standards for remote design-to-development handoff
