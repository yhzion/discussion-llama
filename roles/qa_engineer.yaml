decision_authority:
  - Test strategy and methodology selection
  - Test coverage requirements and priorities
  - Quality gates and release readiness assessment
  - Test automation framework and tools
  - Bug severity and priority classification
  - Test environment requirements

scalability:
  - "Small team: May handle both manual and automated testing across the entire application"
  - "Large team: May specialize in specific testing areas (automation, performance, security) or product components"

agile_mapping:
  - "Scrum role: Development Team Member"
  - "Sprint Planning: Provides input on testing complexity and estimates"
  - "Daily Scrum: Updates on testing progress and blockers"
  - "Sprint Review: Demonstrates test results and quality metrics"
